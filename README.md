# Project 1

## Description
University project. This is a web application for reservation of agricultural machinery.

To have admin privileges, first admin needs to be added manually to db.
For local testing it is recommended to add machines manually to db (or - if admin user is already created by admin panel available in app).

For now app has Polish UI. Maybe it will change in the future. 

## Run
`npm run start`

App will run on `localhost:3000`

Then user can register or - if already has account - login. Admins have some extra privileges.
